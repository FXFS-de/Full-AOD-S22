# Full-AOD-S22
Full AOD for the S22 Base Magisk Module
Magisk is required

This Magisk module changes the floating_feature.xml from 0 to 1.
I've only tested it on the S22 Exynos with ONE UI 7.
If you want to change your background or theme, you have to deactivate the module first, I'm trying to fix this bug soon.

Feel free to open an issue so I can provide support for your Samsung devices. (The prerequisite is that you send me the floating_feature.xml from /etc; this can be done via adb pull or zarchiver.)
